# Regex-Tutorial

A regex, which is short for regular expression, is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern. When included in code or search algorithms, regular expressions can be used to find certain patterns of characters within a string, or to find and replace a character or sequence of characters within a string. They are also frequently used to validate input.

## Regex Components


### Anchors
Purpose of Anchors is to define positions in a string where matches must occur, which are crucial for input validation and precise pattern matching.
Anchors can also be used multiple times in a pattern and combined with other regex elements.

Usage & Examples:

`^`: Matches the start of a string or line.

- Example: `^pikachu`: Matches "pikachu" only at the beginning of a string or line


`$`: Matched the end of s string or line.

- Example: `pikachu$`: Matches "pikachu" only at the end of a string or line.
